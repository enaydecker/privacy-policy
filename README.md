Last updated: Juyl 10, 2025

This GPT uses a weather proxy API hosted by the developer to retrieve weather data  based on the user’s requested location.
Currently only from Accuweather

- No personal data is collected, stored, or shared.
- The input location (e.g., “Berlin”) is used solely to query weather conditions.
- No user-identifiable information is logged or retained.

The API is stateless and does not persist any queries.  
This GPT does not use cookies or trackers.

For questions or concerns, contact the developer.
